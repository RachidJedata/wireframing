## 🧱 Wireframing

### 📌 What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a low-fidelity visual representation of a user interface (UI). It serves as a blueprint that outlines the structure, layout, and functionality of a page or screen—without focusing on colors, images, or visual styling.

Wireframes typically include placeholders for key elements such as:
- Headers and footers
- Navigation bars
- Buttons and forms
- Content blocks and images

### 🎯 Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

Wireframing plays a critical role in the early stages of product development and user experience (UX) design. Its benefits include:

- ✅ **Clarifying Requirements**: Helps teams visualize how features will be structured before development begins.
- 🧠 **Improving Collaboration**: Provides a tangible reference point for discussions between designers, developers, and stakeholders.
- 🛠️ **Reducing Rework**: Identifies usability issues early, reducing costly changes during development.
- 🚀 **Accelerating Prototyping**: Speeds up the process of turning ideas into working prototypes.

Wireframes help bridge the gap between **requirement analysis** and **UI design**, ensuring that functional requirements are mapped clearly to interface elements and user workflows.
